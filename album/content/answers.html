    <h5>You may be wondering...</h5>
    <h4>"What is this crazy idea?"</h4>
    <p>
        Well, I'll tell you. I think we are on the brink of a huge growth opportunity.
        We have rebranded, revamped our website, and are stronger than ever as a company.
        We are still behind the times in our online presence.
    </p>       
    <h4>I know</h4>
    <p>
        We're a stationery company. Classic, timeless, and offering a very tangible product.
        I have researched our competitor's websites, and while I believe that we have made 
        huge strides in the right direction, we can go so much further.
    </p>
    <h4>It is my personal belief that in order to continue down our path of success, we need to expand our digital presence</h4>
    <p>
        This does not need to come at the expense of what is working for us as a company.
        We do not have to sacrifice the handcrafted papers that we are known for. 
        We merely have to translate our offerings into an interface that will take us into our future.
    </p>
    <h4>We can take the same product that has made us great since 1922, and carry it through to the technology of 2022</h4>
    <p>
        A website is an organic experience. We paid to have a great site created for us, but it needs constant TLC. 
        Lacking this, we will end up in the same position that we were in with our old site. 
        It will become outdated, embarassing, and a beastly undertaking to update. 
        I can provide site maintenance, update the content as needed, and implement changes as they arise. 
        From there, I can research and help grow our SEO.
    </p>
    <h4>This is where it gets exciting</h4>
    <p>
        I believe we can, and should, begin the move to online albums. From there the next phase can be online ordering. 
        This will save the company money as well as valuable production time.</p>
    <h4>So, why me?</h4>
    <p>
        I want to expand my skills and grow as a designer, a problem-solver, and a person. 
        I am confident that I have the know-how to help produce these solutions, and the resources to seek help when I don't. 
        I completed a front-end web development course in 2014, and have been working on this as a hobby ever since. 
        I have a keen interest in bridging the gap between printed product and online presence. 
        I value Arzberger, and think we can grow into something even greater than we are.
