        <hr>
        <p class="item-description">The grand size is stately and provides 
            space for multiple lines of copy. This invitation comes with 
            double envelopes as well as a return address.
        </p>
        <p class="item-description">
            Our 330# double-thick card is available in white and ecru 
            and makes a wonderfully sturdy, statement piece. Because of its 
            thickness, it may not be thermographed. When ordering a piece 
            in double-thick stock, please indicate the 330# selection. 
            Please note that 330# cards are cut slightly smaller in 
            order to fit smoothly into envelopes.
        </p>
        <p class="item-description">
            Beveling is a beautiful embellishment. Cards may be beveled in 
            any ink color, or none at all, and are available 
            with square or round corners. When ordering, clearly indicate 
            ink selection and corner treatment.
            PLEASE NOTE: A Bevel may be applied to any stock. 
            For Bevel cost, refer to "General Additional Charges."
            Beveling adds up to 3 weeks to standard production time.
